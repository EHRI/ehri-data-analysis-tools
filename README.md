# EHRI Collection of Digital Tools Guides

Team members of the European Holocaust Research Infrastructure (EHRI) from King’s College London and the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum have created a series of guides to help researchers of the Holocaust and other related fields use digital tools in their research.  

In conversation with researchers working in Holocaust and refugee studies through events organized by EHRI, it has become apparent that many researchers have an interest in learning more about digital tools and methods that they hear discussed at EHRI events, but that they are not sure how to learn more about them.  

In order to help researchers discover more about digital tools that are available and demonstrate how they can be used we have created a collection of digital tool guides that are available through this repository. The guides consist of screenshots and easy to follow, step-by-step instructions to help researchers – regardless of technical ability – experiment successfully with digital tools.  

The guides cover a variety of topics including using referencing software, capturing tables from webpages and putting them in spreadsheets, entity matching (developed by EHRI) and using the data in Google Maps, extracting data using EHRI APIs, topic modeling, and using OpenCV for facial recognition.  

We hope that these guides will offer inspiration to researchers to encourage them to experiment with using digital tools as part of their research, and to learn new skills.
