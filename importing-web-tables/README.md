Importing tables from websites into spreadsheets
================================================

Sometimes it can be useful to take information from a website, such as
document lists from archives, for future reference. If these items are
in a table on a webpage you can download an extension to your browser
that will allow you to copy the data from the webpage into a
spreadsheet. In this example the browser is Chrome. You can find table
capture extensions by googling ‘table capture’ and choosing one of the
table capture extensions and click ‘Add to Chrome’.

Once table capture is added to Chrome you should find a shortcut to the
extension added to your toolbar in the upper righthand side of the
screen.

Go to the page from which you wish to capture the information and click
on the table capture shortcut button. This will open the extension and
will show the tables that have been identified on the page. If you bring
your cursor over the different selections, they will be highlighted on
the webpage so that you can make sure you are copying the correct data.
If you don’t see your table, you can click ‘Select in Page’ and
highlight the information.

Once the data has been recognised by the table capture extension you can
either copy data to the clipboard and paste into an Excel file, or
export the table to Google Sheets.

This can be a useful way of quickly creating a document list to consult
in an archive, or for many other research purposes.
