    "## What is Topic Modelling?\n",
    "\n",
    "Topic modelling is a technique by which documents within a corpus are clustered based on the manner in which certain groups of terms are used together within the text. The commonalities between such term groupings tend to form what we would normally call “topics”, providing a way to automatically categorise documents by their structural content, rather than any a priori knowledge system. Topic modelling is generally most effective when a corpus is large and diverse, so the individual documents within in are not too similar in composition. In EHRI, of course, we focus on the Holocaust, so documents available to us are naturally restricted in scope. It was an interesting experiment, however, to test to what extent a corpus of Holocaust-related documents was able to be topic modelled, and what “topics” emerged within it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The specific type of topic modelling we’re looking at is called latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), subject of an influential paper by Blei et al. (2003)."

    "## The Dataset/Putting Together the Corpus\n",
    "We were on the lookout for datasets that would be easily accessible and, for convenience, predominantly in English. One such dataset was the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum’s (USHMM) extensive collection of oral history testimonies, for which there are a considerable number of textual transcripts. The museum’s total collection consists of over 80,703 testimonies, 41,695 of which are available in English, with 2,894 of them listing a transcript.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since there is not yet a ready-to-download dataset that includes these transcripts, we had to construct our own. Using a web scraping tool, we managed to create a list of the links pointing to the metadata (including transcripts) of the testimonies that were of interest to us. After obtaining the transcript and other metadata of each of these testimonies, we were able to create our dataset and curate it to remove any unwanted entries. For example, we made sure to remove entries with restrictions on access or use. We also removed entries with transcripts that consisted only of some automatically generated headers and entries which turned out to be in languages other than English. The remaining 1,873 transcripts form the corpus of this tutorial — a small, but still decently sized dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the testimonies comprising our corpus come from survivors of the Holocaust. These testimonies are usually the output of an interview process, which typically follows a certain structure. For example, the Oral History Interview Guidelines published by the USHMM state that interviews with Holocaust survivors are usually structured in three parts: ‘prewar life, the Holocaust and wartime experiences, and postwar experiences’ (United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, 2007, p. 26). There are definite limitations to what topic modelling can reveal about a collection of documents that relate to the same general subject (in this case, the Holocaust) and that follow a more-or-less similar structure, but the results are nonetheless interesting and potentially useful."

    "Research on text duplication and its effects on the LDA model (Schofield, Thompson, et al., 2017) suggests that the LDA model can generally handle text duplication well and duplicate texts need to cover a substantial part of the corpus before they begin to hinder the model's ability to come up with good topics. That being said, for demonstration purposes, we decided to find and remove duplicate texts in this tutorial despite the fact that they cover a rather small fraction of the corpus. An alternative would be to train the model without removing duplicate text and then if the model were to come up with a small number of topics dedicated to the repeated texts, we could safely ignore those topics (Schofield, Thompson, et al., 2017)."

    "As briefly mentioned at the beginning of this notebook, through trial and error, we noticed that the model would come up with topics that comprised words in German or Dutch. This made us suspect that some transcripts which were not in English infiltrated our dataset. To put this assumption to the test, we searched for transcripts that contained the word \"nicht\". It is true that in the transcripts of Holocaust-related oral testimonies one might often find that interviewees might speak in multiple languages. Searching for this word within the transcripts returned transcripts that were mostly in English. However, we noticed that at least three of them were in other languages. They were thus removed."

    "We load a list of default stopwords from the `nltk` package (Bird et al., 2009). Stopwords are the most common words that tend to appear in texts. These words are considered to be unhelpful when it comes to topic inference because they are present in almost every text regardless of its topic, thus being uninformative. In our case, we also want to extend this stopword list with custom words that are repeated within our corpus, which we know are uninformative. For example, there are some repeating headers that were automatically added to the majority of these transcripts and include words such as \"verbatim\", \"transcript\", \"spoken\", \"word\", \"spelling\", etc. There are other words such as \"indecipherable\" which are part of certain remarks made by the person who created the transcript but which are not related to the topic of the testimony.\n",
    "\n",
    "Stopword removal should take place with caution. According to prior studies (Schofield, Magnusson, et al., 2017), removing stopwords from the resulting topics after training the model is likely to lead to similar results as removing them beforehand. Thus, stopword removal might not be as beneficial in topic inference as it is thought to be. Avoiding this step might save researchers time and mitigates the chances of biased stopword selection (Schofield, Magnusson, et al., 2017). If one decides to remove the stopwords, it is suggested to remove only the most \"obvious\" (Schofield, Magnusson, et al., 2017) and highly frequent words."

    "Another popular technique of text preprocessing for topic modelling is to lemmatise or stem the words in the corpus. Lemmatisation is the process of replacing the word in the corpus with its lemma, meaning the base form of the word as it would appear in the dictionary (Manning et al., 2009). Stemming is the process of removing the suffixes of words and keeping only the part of the word that precedes them (Manning et al., 2009).\n",
    "\n",
    "When it comes to inferring topic models, previous studies suggest that lemmatisation improves topic coherence (Martin & Johnson, 2015; Lau et al., 2014). Martin and Johnson (2015) maintain that keeping only the nouns of the lemmatised texts improves topic coherence and speed. However, other studies suggest that applying stemming and lemmatisation during text preprocessing offers little benefit and, in some cases, might even harm the topic model  (Schofield & Mimno, 2016).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will demonstrate how to lemmatise the texts and keep only certain parts of speech (in this case the nouns), using spaCy (Honnibal et al., 2020), a popular Natural Language Processing (NLP) Python library. However, we encourage readers to consider a lighter text preprocessing approach before resorting to such techniques."
